                        <p>I came in with my daughter when she was about 4 months old. She had such a blast from day one!
                            The activities were so engaging and this really aided in her development. This was also a great 
                            way to get out of the house and having her intract with other children as I am a stay at home mom.
                            I highly recommend this!

                        <p>I started these classes when my baby was about 2 months old. He had some issues with his co-ordination 
                            and these classes were so useful and got him up to speed in no time! The only slight downside here was that the class 
                            location is a bit far to drive to for me here in Durban. Other than that I urge all moms to consider this.
